	<h3 style="text-align: left;">About the Blackhat Visualisation</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">The blackhat visualisation(also known as "bad actor") is meant to show all the victims of mass shooting in th United States of America. </p>
		<p style="text-align: left;"> The visualisation misleads the people as there are no clear state boundaries and it just shows the circles over east and west coast. </p>
		<p style="text-align: left;"> Also, the visualisation has a misleading title stating that the Chicago area and the east coast are dangerous places to live in but there is no clear explanantion of that claim. The places where less deaths occured were intentionally removed from the map and the red circle over Chicago was cretaed to grab the readers attention over that spot. </p>
	<h3 style="text-align: left;">About the Whitehat Visualisation</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;"> The white hat visualisation improves over the bad actor by adding the state lines so that the viewer can clearly see how many deaths occured in each city. Tooltips were added to see the gender distribution of the fatalities over each city.</p>
		<p style="text-align: left;"> The visualisation points out the death count over the cities and makes out the obvious fact that cities with higher population have a higher death count.</p>
		<p style="text-align: left;"> More insight is provided over the gender ratio of the casualities as the reader is given the option to see counts of deaths of males and females over every city. The color encoding for each gender is also different to make the mapping more clear.</p>
